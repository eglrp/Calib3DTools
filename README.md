# Calib3DTools
* This software is a tool for image processing. It is in fact a result of my 3-month internship in _IMAGINE Laboratory_ (http://imagine.enpc.fr), a a joint research group between _Ecole des Ponts ParisTech_ and _Centre Scientifique et Technique du Batiment_.
* This software intergrates some results of research, especially some algorithms and methodologies invented by researchers in _IMAGINE Laboratory_. The goal of this projet is to evaluate the precision of state-of-art method of 3D reconstruction by stereovision.
* It uses a small part of code in the OpenMVG library (https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG)
* It consists of the following modules:
1. "Distortion" : High-precision camera distortion using the "harp methode"[1], this module will calculate a distortion polynomial from some "harp" photos.
2. "Photo" : Where you load photos, correct the distortion by applying distortion polynomial transformation and then save them.
3. "KMatrix" : Calculation of K Matrix using the "circular control points" [2]
4. "Point2D" : A user friendly interface for selecting target points on images, which will then be used to get the ground truth of camera position with the help of Lidar generated points cloud.
5. "Point3D" : User should give 3D coordinates of target points (extracted from 3D points cloud generated by Lidar)
6. "Camera" : With help of a module in OpenMVG library, the ground truth of 3d camera coordinates will be calculated from the following data: "Point2D", "Point3D" and "KMatrix"
7. "CameraCompare" : Before using this module, we should use OpenMVG library to do stereovision from distortion-corrected photos. We will then get 3d reconstruction result together with 3d coordinates of cameras. What we want to evaluate is the precision of 3d coordinates of cameras because it determines the precision of 3d reconstruction. For evaluating, we compare camera positions with ground truth found by "Camera" module
